COVID-19 Dashboard 🚀

Hello everyone, hope all are well, but not may be in 2020 😅, due to the corona pandemic. I'm going to build the same ML project but before it, i think let's build a straightforward dashboard of COVID.

New challenge after work on the Dragon Real Estate Price Predictor, I ventured into the realms of data science and machine learning. This journey led me to create an insightful COVID-19 Dashboard using Dash and Plotly!
This dashboard goes beyond statistics, narrating the story of the pandemic with visual representations of total cases, recoveries, and more. The transition from real estate predictions to data analytics has been a thrilling experience, and I’m excited to delve deeper into this field.

🔍 Features:
Total Cases, Active, Recovered, and Deaths: A concise overview of the pandemic's current status.
Breakdown by State, City, and District: Detailed charts showcasing case numbers across different regions.
Age & Gender Distribution: Simple pie charts illustrating the demographics affected.
Current Status: Real-time information on hospitalized, recovered, and deceased cases.

💻 Technologies Used:
Python: Leveraging Pandas for efficient data handling and processing.
Dash & Plotly: Crafting an interactive, user-friendly web app with dynamic charts and graphs.
Seaborn & Plotly Express: Enhancing visualizations with additional styling and clarity.
